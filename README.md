# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
 const TokenA = "0xcEA38fac44aeb835b6b8719dE84FB471471b264f";
    const TokenB = "0x06d1E46ca659936f8A85522D3bf7A72AAd8D187b";
    const swapAddress = "0x28B49B5693847549116223853Ea5E6060C9972B3";
Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
